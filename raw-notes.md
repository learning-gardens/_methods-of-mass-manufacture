### PLASTICS and POLYMERS

"PLASTIC"
  - is a property of a material not the material itself
  - from the greek word "plastikos" which means moldable

### Primary Plastic Families

1. Thermoplastics - over 240 types
  - reconstitution ability
  - remelt capacity
  - ex: PETE water bottles / PET milk jugs

2. Thermosets - around 60 types
  - chemical reaction
  - solid/permanent
  - ex: galvanized rubber

### Materials Selection

MOLECULAR ARRANGEMENT

Crystalline & Amorphous plastics

•how the molecules are organized as they solidify has an impact on the material's properties.

•In general molecules arrange themselves in an amorphous or semi-crystalline way

IMPORTANT CONCEPT 2

polys are either crystalline or amporphous

amorphous = transparent
crystalline = translucent

POLYMER CATEGORIES

thermoplastics - when heated become flexible and formable

*can be heated and reformed

thermosets - have long chain molecules chemically bonded to the other long chains.

*cannot be remelted

### THERMOSETS

cannot be recycled or reused (car tyres)
rigid or flexible (seat upholstery)
good for high heat and chemical resistant applications

thermosets include:

silicones
phenolics (bakealite)
epoxy
urea-formaldehyde
polyurethanes *

### THERMO PLASTICS*

used heavily in food packaging

thermoplastics include
polyethylene
polypropylene
abs
styrene

### PROPERTY MODIFICATION

MACHINNES CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO

Platten Size (size tool fit inside)

Clamp TOnnage*

Small machine > 99T

Medium Machine 99-2000T

Jumbo Machines 2000-10000T

INJECTION MOLDING PROCESS

Ejector pin*

### DESIGN FOR INJECTION MOLDING*
•Draft* - sides somewhat angled
•Radii - 
•No Undercuts
•Constant Wall Thickness
•Part line* - line determining half line between top tooling and bottom tooling

red dots - water lines

red lined bulky parts - mold base

screw - long part of T  ( vertical)

runner - short part of T (horizontal)

red square surrounding mold cavity - Main Die and cavities (hard steel outside, soft steel inside)

red pin above mold cavity - ejector pin system

###### DRAFT

*typically 2 degrees of draft *
(there can be 0degree and negative degree draft, only with additional help)

the more aggressive the texture the greater the draft * 

every 50 mm in height 2• draft will push out 3.5 mm

flashing * - tool degradation leading to increased excess polymer on parting line

###### WALL THICKNESS

needs to be consistent

even cooling
reduce warpage
reduce sink marks*
reduce stress in part
mould flow easier

generally 2-4 mm thickness

if part big need thicker walls

different materials need thicker walls due to flow.

Ex. ABS need a min. of 1.1mm

less material better

lower material cost reduce cooling time

###### RADII

all corners should have radii

•reduce stress in parts
•increase strength
•assist melt flow
•better cooling

*RADII MINIMUM OF .5mm

###### PART LINE

flatter is cheaper and better seal

SPECIAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

undercuts
weld lines
anisotropy
gates and sprues
threads

###### UNDERCUTS* 

sliding cores (cam core)

•cam sliding core (mechanical)
avoid unless completely necessary*
add cost to tooling for: cost of making tool  cost of maintenance
however viable: reduce need for other parts / particular visual effect needed

•spring cores

•hydrolic cores

shut off faces
pop off mold

###### WELD LINES*

a weld line is an opportunity for fracture

pack out 

###### ANISTROPY*
warpage or shrinkage of part due to inconsistent mold flow or interfering mold flow

## DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURING
 
Generally, an Industrial Designer will find themselves considering **technical** (read: regardless of use-context or human factors) **requirements** in the form of “Designing for X”, where ‘X’ stands for any of the following:

```
x = [assembly, reliability, recycleability, serviceability, environmental impact, manufacturability]
```

For now, we’ll be going over the last item in this list, Design for Manufacturing, or DFM.

DFM: measure of efficiency with which raw materials can be processed into Product

DFM relies on cross-disciplinary team — may include but not limited to:

- manufacturing engineers
- industrial designers
- cost accountants
- production personel

### DFM: Guidelines for Design and Form:

1. Guidelines for Designing
	- reduce number of product parts**
	- use modular elements
	- strive for gravity-based assembly
	- use standard parts if possible {cheaper}
	- eliminate/reduce number of threaded fasteners {use snap fit}
	- use self-aligning or self-nesting parts
	- use symmetrical parts for easier assembly
	- design for automation {use human assemblers wisely}
	- match design to material to process**
	- design parts that are impossible to assemble improperly
	- design for ease of fabrication**
2. Guidelines for Physical Form
	- Product form* remember two of these
	- avoid deep narrow grooves, long thing legs and undercuts
	- avoid sharp corners
	- avoid abrupt changes in section
	- avoid unnecessary hollow shapes
	- avoid knife edges, as they cause wavy edges
	- provide generous filets and rounds
	- design sections for uniform wall thickness
	- use rib stiffeners to reduce twisting

### DFM: VACUUM FORMING

In general:

•tooling cheap because low pressure tools (timber aluminum, epoxies)
•good for low production***
•good for large large parts**
•limited depth (about 1:4)
•limited colors
•limited materials
•no internal details from molding
•much post mold fabrication

Applications:****

•low volume products
•large products (car bodies)
•food packaging
•product packaging***

### DFM: Vacuum forming

draft** - typically 2° + / on male molds parts shrink onto part making removal difficult

radii** - required on corners to allow material to flow across corners natural external radii due to process in female molds

no undercuts** - impossible to remove from mold, (only on top) 

part line** - keep the general shape simple, secondary operation so the easier the better

### DFM: Pressure forming

Advantages

•sharp features*
•undercuts*
•molded textures*
•low tooling cost compared to inject molding
•prototyping injection molded part

Applications

•low volume products
•product packaging***
•large products

### DFM: OTHER CLOSED MOULD PROCESSES

plastics
•RIM
•structural foam
•gas assist
•injection moulding
•co-injection moulding
•over-moulding

metals
•die casting

### RIM - Reaction Injection Moulding

two parts pre-mixed and fed into tool
reacts and sets
foams due to gas created by chemical reactions

Advantages
•low pressures > cheaper tooling (aluminium)
•simpler machines
•cellular core, integral skin
•good finishes that are paint-able
•can include glass reinfocement

Disadvantages
•uses isocyantes
•parts usually painted (extra process)

Applications
•car bumper bars, body panels and hoods, structural elements
•car arm rests, steering wheels (integral skin)
•steering wheels (integral skin and metal reinforcing inserts)

### DFM: STRUCTURAL FOAM

similar to inject moulding

1.plastic has a blowing agent OR nitrogen added
2.melted plastic shot into cavity, only partially filled 
3.nozzles closed off
4.gas bubbles expand to finish filling cavity
5.part cooled, then removed

Advantages
•high strength to weight ratio
•reduced part weight
•ticker wall sections > 13mm thick
•low pressures > cheaper tooling
•internal pressure eliminates sinks
•because low pressure do very large parts cheaply

Disadvantages
•swirly pattern on surface
•

Applications
Large structural parts

### DFM: GAS-ASSIST INJECT. MOULDING

developed in the 80's

1.a short shot of plastic is injected into the mould cavity
2.it is then inflated with nitrogen to fill out the mould
3.part cools, gas vented (otherwise part blows up)

Applications
•handles, toilet seats
•wheels
•large parts (tabletops) to assist filling the part, reduce tool pressure
•transportation industry (need for strong light parts)

### DFM: CO-INJ. MOULDING

x

HOW IS PLASTIC FORMED

1 heat plastic
2 plastic softens
3 plastic pusshed into mold
4 plastic cools in shape
5 part extracted from mold

4+5 important to designer, they determine the shape possibilities available to the designer

Notes on ‘rules’
•follow ‘rules’ for easiest cheapest parts
•breakable
•know how to break them
•play with them

## AMORTIZATION

It is all about costs and money! 
Molding processes to be chosen

cost of tool translates costs to the..
•cost of part
•often shape nature of part dictates process chosen

Tooling Amortization
Amortization = ***
pay something off gradually over time

For example: Domino’s Pizza car top sign
need to know
•how many to be made
•over what time frame

vacuum forming
tool cost $5000
part cost $15

injection molding
tool cost 20,000$
part cost 4$

Make 500 parts

vac forming
5000$/500 = $10 each part to go to tooling
part cost=$10+$15 = $25

injection molding
$20,000/500 = $40 each to go to tooling
part cost = $40 + $4 = $44

Part cost per unit ***

in general the higher the cooling costs than the..
cheaper the parts
less labor and finishing
suitable for higher volumes

### Over Moulding

how modern toothbrushes are made 

the first part is injection mouldded 

the mould is changed (various ways) and another plastic is moulded OVER the first part

TEPE - thermoplastic elastomer

Advantages
•reduce need for assembly
•innovative product features
•can do up to 3 shots over base part
•coat less for 1 over mould tool than for two part tools
•use materials for benefits, eg. structural core, exterior soft feel
•materials should be compatible

### Bi Injection moulding

### Casting

Aluminum, zinc, and alloy casting is similar to injection moulding process.
•sand casting
•gravity die casting
•high pressure die casting
•low pressure die casting

Die casting VS. Injection moulding

very similar properties

die casting gives properties of metals
•stronger and stiffer
•greater dimensional stability
•protect from EMI
•better chrome plating
•no creep
•UV stable
•Chemically resistant

### Sand Casting - MISSED

### Joining plastics

Plastics often part of assemblies of parts - parts need to be attached to each other

Main methods of plastic joining:

- chemical bond
- welding
- Mechanical

ROD WELDING

like metal welding, uses hot air to melt rods and surfaces.

OTHER WELDING TYPES

hot staking
laser welding

MECHANCAL

Snap fits
molded in undercuts used to join parts

•in line of draw
•spin off side core
•molded in threads
•pop-off

screws
•threaded inserts
•self tapping

Screws - self tapping

Screws - threaded inserts
•moulded in
•ultrasonically inserted post mould

Screws - general

parts must be designed so screw housing and boss carry load

#### METALS

There are two types of metals:

1. Ferrous: Indicates the presence of iron > 3 types of molecular crystal formation
2. Non-Ferrous: Metals and alloys w/o and appreciable amount of iron

NON-FERROUS — There are three types of crystalline formations for non-ferrous metals:

- Body Centered Cubic: 
	- tungsten , chromium , Alpha Iron (ferrite)
- Face Centered Cubic: 
	- Aluminium , Copper , Gold , Lead , Nickel, Iron above crit. temp.

Powdered Metallurgy: 
Process
1. Metal powders are mixed with lubricants and or other materials to create a homogenous mixture.
2. Mixture is fed into a die and compacted at 20,000 to 120,000 psi. This results in a green compact.
3.The green compact passes through a sintering furnace that is heated below the melting temperature of the base metal. 
4. Parts may be later processed.

low carbon: highest volume produced, notable for their formability.
medium carbon: normally quenched and tempered, versatile.
hi carbon: lower ductility, restricted formability + weld ability.
Iron

4 forms: 
liquid form - FUKEN LIQUID BRO
delta form - molten iron cools into this > body centered cubic
gamma form - further cools > face centered cubic 
alpha form - further cooled, becomes magnetic > body centered cubic

======Magnesium
Magnesium, is the eighth most abundant element in the earth's crust at about 2.5 % of its composition. It's high chemical reactivity means that it does not occur in the metallic state in nature. An important use is in preventing the corrosion of iron and steel.
Nickel
Alloying Agent: More than 50% of the world's nickel (Ni - atomic no. 28) production issued as an alloying addition to stabilize the austenitic structure of stainless steel. 
Stainless Steel (5 classes)
Ferritic: contain between 11 and 30% chromium and have a low carbon content.
Martensitic: contain 11-17% chromium and carbon contents up to the 1% range.
Austenitic: contain 17-25% chromium and 7-35% nickel.
Duplex:contain 23-30% chromium, 2-7% nickel and minor amounts of titanium or molybdenum.
Some stainless steels which are alloyed with small quantities of other elements to permit precipitation-hardening.
Titanium
Fact 1: Titanium is a brilliant white metal in its pure form. It is the ninth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, obtained from rutile, ilmenite and sphens, as well as vitanites and many iron ores. 
Discovery: Metallic titanium was first isolated in impure form in 1887 and with higher purity in 1910. However, it was not until the 1950's that it began to come into use as a structural material. This was initially stimulated by aircraft applications.
Tool Steel
Fact 1: Tool steels are ferrous alloys that are intended for use in the working and shaping of metallic and non-metallic materials. Applications include drills, dies for extrusion, casting forming, thread rolling and deep drawing, shear blades, punches and cutting tools such as chisels, lathe tools and milling cutters. 
4 Tool Steel classes:
Ledeburitic Cr-steels 
Cold work steels 
Hot work steels
Steels for plastic molding 
Fact 3: High Speed Steels > good for cutting at "HIGH SPEEDS"
